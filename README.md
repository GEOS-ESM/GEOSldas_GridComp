# GEOSldas_GridComp

The `GEOSldas_GridComp` repository contains the source code for the GEOS land modeling and data assimilation system (`GEOSldas`). 


## History

The repository was created in March 2024 by extracting the GEOSldas source code from the [`GEOSldas` fixture](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSldas). 

The new repository was needed to facilitate the use of the `GEOSldas_GridComp` as an external repository in both the [`GEOSldas` fixture](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSldas) and the [GEOS atmospheric data assimilation (`GEOSadas`) fixture](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSadas).
